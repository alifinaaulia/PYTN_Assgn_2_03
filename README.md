### Statistical Hypothesis Test of NYC Property Sales Dataset
### Project Overview
The dataset used in this project is NYC Property Sales Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.

This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:

- BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).
- BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.
- BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time.
